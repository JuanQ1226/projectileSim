# Projectile Simulator
In this personal project I'll be aplying what I've learned in my first physics class about the kinematic equations, with the help of the C++ openFrameworks library :)
## About: 
The program calculates the position of a particle using the kinematic equations. The particle and it's movement is drawn grafically with the help of the openFrameworks library.
## Features:
  - Draws the particle and it's trail
  - The initial condition of the particle(speed,position,angle,etc..) can be changed intuitively with a simple GUI.
  - You can also drag the particle with your mouse by left clicking on it.
  - The initial angle and speed of the particle is inidicated on the particle by a arrow that grow with the speed and point toward the angle of the particle.
 
### Features I want to add:
  - Calculate max speed,height and range.
  - Tracking of the particle when it passes the bounds of the window.
  - Adding more partices and collisions between the particles.
